### Pong Arcade Game

#### Overview:
This Python project brings the classic arcade game Pong to life using the `turtle` module. It provides an engaging and interactive experience where players can compete against each other in a virtual game of Pong. The game features player-controlled paddles, a moving ball, and a scoreboard to track points.

#### Features:
- **Turtle Graphics**: The game utilizes methods from the `turtle` module to create game components and handle player interactions.
- **Player Controls**: Users can control the movement of the left and right paddles using designated keybindings.
- **Collision Detection**: The program detects collisions between the ball and player paddles to determine gameplay outcomes.
- **Scoreboard**: A scoreboard is displayed on the screen, updating in real-time to reflect the current score of the game.
- **Customizable Settings**: Players can experiment with different game settings to understand their effects on gameplay dynamics.

#### Installation:
No additional installations are required beyond Python itself.

#### Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. The game window will appear, featuring the game components, including player paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard.
3. Use the designated keybindings to control the movement of the left and right player paddles.
4. The ball will bounce off the paddles and walls, and points will be scored based on the gameplay rules.
5. The game continues until one player reaches the maximum score or the players decide to end the game.

#### Example:
- Start the game by running the Python script.
- Use the arrow keys or other designated keys to control the movement of the player paddles.
- Hit the ball with the paddles to prevent it from reaching your side of the screen and score points by sending it past your opponent's paddle.
- The scoreboard will update in real-time to reflect the current score of the game.

#### Notes:
- Players can customize various aspects of the game, such as paddle speed, ball speed, and game duration, by adjusting the corresponding settings in the code.
- Experiment with different settings to understand how they affect the gameplay experience.
